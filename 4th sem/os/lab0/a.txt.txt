Arya Stark is a fictional character in American author George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire epic fantasy novel series. She is a prominent point of view character in the novels, and is the only viewpoint character to appear in every published book of the series.

Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Arya is the younger daughter and third child of Lord Eddard Stark and his wife Lady Catelyn Stark.

She wields a smallsword named Needle, a gift from her half-brother, Jon Snow, and is trained in the Braavosi style of sword fighting by Syrio Forel.
